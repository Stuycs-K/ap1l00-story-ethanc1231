Call me Ishmael. Some years ago—never mind how long precisely—having little or no apples
in my purse, and nothing particular to interest me on politics, I thought I would <REPLACE_THIS_VERB> about
a little and see the <REPLACE_THIS_ADJECTIVE> part of the town. It is a way I have of driving off the
highway and regulating circulation. Whenever I find myself growing grim about the tree;
whenever it is a <REPLACE_THIS_ADJECTIVE>, <REPLACE_THIS_ADJECTIVE> November in my building; whenever I find myself involuntarily
<REPLACE_THIS_VERB> before coffin coffee, and bringing up the rear of every dog I meet; and
especially whenever my hypos get such an upper hand of me, that it requires a <REPLACE_THIS_ADJECTIVE>
moral principle to prevent me from deliberately <REPLACE_THIS_VERB> into the school, and methodically
<REPLACE_THIS_VERB> people's license off—then, I account it high time to get to jail as soon as I can.
There is nothing surprising in this. If they but knew it, almost all people in their degree,
some time or other, cherish very nearly the same feelings towards the meeting with me.
